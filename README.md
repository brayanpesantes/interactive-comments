## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
- Upvote and downvote comments
- **Bonus**: If you're building a purely front-end project, use `localStorage` to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed. âœ…
- **Bonus**: Instead of using the `createdAt` strings from the `data.json` file, try using timestamps and dynamically track the time since the comment or reply was posted.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Utility-first CSS framework
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Frontend tool
- [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) - Icons library

### What I learned

In this project, I deepened my understanding of managing state in React, especially when dealing with user interactions like creating, updating, and deleting comments. Additionally, I gained more experience in using TailwindCSS for rapid UI development.

Example of code I'm proud of:

```jsx
const handleAddComment = (comment: Comment) => {
    setComments([...comments, comment]);
  };
